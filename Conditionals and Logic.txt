# CONDITIONALS AND LOGIC
------------------------

* Introduction to Conditionals & Logic
--------------------------------------
	Every program we’ve seen so far has only had one possible path of execution — they all execute line by line, from top to bottom. And every time you run one of those programs, it 
	gives you the same exact result. But it’s the twenty-first century, and we like options!

	In this lesson, we will explore how programs make decisions by evaluating conditions and introduce logic into our code!

	We’ll be covering the following concepts:

		. if, else if, and else statements
		. switch statements
		. Relational operators
		. Logical operators

	So… if you’ve already learned these concepts in another language, go to the next lesson — else, prepare yourself and let’s get started!

* Coin Flip Demo
----------------
	Before we dive deep into the syntax of the if statement, let’s do a demo!

	Here, we have coinflip.cpp program that simulates a coin toss:

		. 50% of the time, it’s Heads.
		. 50% of the time, it’s Tails.

coinflip.cpp
------------
#include <iostream>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <ctime>

int main() {
  
  // Create a number that's 0 or 1
  
  srand (time(NULL));
  int	coin = rand() % 2;
  
  // If number is 0: Heads
  // If it is not 0: Tails
  
  if (coin == 0) {
  
    std::cout << "Heads\n";
  
  }
	else {
	
    std::cout << "Tails\n";
  
  }
  
}
